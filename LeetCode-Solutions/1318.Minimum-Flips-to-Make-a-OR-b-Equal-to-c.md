# 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c
## Problem Statement:
Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).
Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

Example 1:

Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)

Example 2:

Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= a <= 10^9
1 <= b <= 10^9
1 <= c <= 10^9

## Solution Idea (O(1)):
For each bit in C if this bit is 0 I'll count 1 if A had 1 in this position and another 1 if B has 1 in this position (2 if both had 1 in this position).
if C has 1 in this bit I'll check if both A and B had 0 in this position I'll flip anyone of them and count 1.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
        int flips = 0;
        for(int bit = 0; bit < 31;bit++) {
            if((c & (1<<bit)) == 0) {
                // to have 0 we fill do a flip for anyone has 1 in this position 
                flips+= ((b & (1<<bit)) != 0);
                flips+= ((a & (1<<bit)) != 0);
            } else {
                // if at this bit c is 1
                // both are zeros so we count 1 to filp anyone of them
                flips+= (((a & (1<<bit)) == 0) && ((b & (1<<bit)) == 0));
            }
        }
        
        return flips;
    }
};
