# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies
## Problem Statement:
Given the array candies and the integer extraCandies, where candies[i] represents the number of candies that the ith kid has.

For each kid check if there is a way to distribute extraCandies among the kids such that he or she can have the greatest number of candies among them. Notice that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
 
## Solution Idea (O(n)):
For each kid to reach the greatest number of candies the optimal is to take all the extra candies. Then check after taking all the extra candies if he still has less number of candies than the maximum of candies then it means noway to reach the greatest number of candies So we push false else push true to the array

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> kidsWithCandies(vector<int>& candies, int extraCandies) {
        vector<bool> canReachMax;
        
        int mx = 0;
        for(int kid: candies) {
            mx = max(mx, kid);
        }
        
        for(int kid: candies) {
            canReachMax.push_back((kid+extraCandies >= mx));
        }
        
        return canReachMax;
    }
};
