# 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
## Problem Statement:
Given a non-negative integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2, otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

Input: num = 14
Output: 6
 
## Solution Idea (O(log(n))):
We just followed the instructions in problem statement.

### C++ (Runtime: 0 ms)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfSteps (int num) {
        int count = 0;
        while(num != 0) {
            if(num%2) {
                num-=1;
            } else {
                num/=2;
            }
            count++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

### Python (Runtime: 24 ms)
```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfSteps (self, num: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while num != 0:
            if num%2 != 0:
                num-=1
            else:
                num/=2
            count+=1
        return count
