# 1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game
## Problem Statement:
Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (" ").
The first player A always places "X" characters, while the second player B always places "O" characters.
"X" and "O" characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
No more moves can be played if the game is over.
Given an array moves where each element is another array of size 2 corresponding to the row and column of the grid where they mark their respective character in the order in which A and B play.

Return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B), in case the game ends in a draw return "Draw", if there are still movements to play return "Pending".

You can assume that moves is valid (It follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty and A will play first.


Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]

Output: "A"

Explanation: "A" wins, he always plays first.
"X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "    "X  "
"   " -> "   " -> " X " -> " X " -> " X "
"   "    "O  "    "O  "    "OO "    "OOX"


Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]

Output: "B"

Explanation: "B" wins.
"X  "    "X  "    "XX "    "XXO"    "XXO"    "XXO"
"   " -> " O " -> " O " -> " O " -> "XO " -> "XO " 
"   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "   "    "O  "


Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]

Output: "Draw"

Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.

"XXO"

"OOX"

"XOX"



Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1]]

Output: "Pending"

Explanation: The game has not finished yet.

"X  "

" O "

"   "

## Solution Idea (O(3*3) => O(1)):
We will have a turn variable which is equal to `0` if it `As` turn else `1` if `Bs` turn.
We loop on the moves and for each step we update the board by the move and call check function. if any row, column or diagonal matchs the criteria we return the winner.

After finishing all the moves we check if the moves has length of 9 (which is the number of all cells) it means that we did all the possible moves and the result is `"Draw"` else it means there's more moves we can do so we return `"Pending"`.
